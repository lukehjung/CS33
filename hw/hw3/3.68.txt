A = 9, B = 5

Going line by line.

movslq 8(%rsi), %rax shows that since an int is aligned by 4,
4 < B <= 8.

addq 32(%rsi), %rax shows that since a long is aligned by 8 and it's size of B and
a short is 4 bytes, it'll be 24 < 12 + A*2 <= 32, or 6 < A <= 10

movq %rax. 184(%rdi) shows that since long is aligned by 8, and before it is the size 
of the two variables together, it's 176 < A*B*4 <= 184 or 44 < A*B <= 46

4 < B <= 8
5 < A <= 10
44 < A*B <= 46

Therefore A = 9, B = 5
