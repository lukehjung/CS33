Gather Instruction Traces:

1. gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.1
Open gdb with the directory of emacs 26.1

2. (gdb) break Ftimes
Set a breakpoint at function Times to check
Every time Ftimes is called and check instructions

3. (gdb) set disassemble-next-line on
Show paragraphs of text whenever debugging it shows
information of where the pointer is at

4. r -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
Run the eval function provided from the website

5. (gdb) si
Steps through each machine instruction one at a time

6. (gdb) info registers $rip
Check each register that was changed everytime step through
an instruction

Aside: Something that was frustrating was I wasn't able to step
back when I was going through the code, so if I missed checking a
register, I had to rerun the program.  However I realized I got 
copy the machine instruction and break it there to quickly find my
spot. 
Also, I wasn't able to export my input to a log file because the pwd 
was saved somewhere I wasn't able to create files, so I had to copy 
paste a lot from terminal.
